This is the code to generate my personal website using [Eleventy][1].

## Acknowledgements

* The minimalist design was inspired by a Hugo theme called [Hermit][2]. I reworked basically everything myself (making it _even more_ minimal). Though I did copy a few snippets outright such as a couple SVG icons.
* [Favycon][3], an open source favicon generator.
