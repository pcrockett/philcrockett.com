    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <section>
        <p>I am an American living in Germany with my wife and dog. We spend our free time hanging out with people, going outside, playing games, and traveling. I work remotely for an American company building software, while my wife teaches English.</p>
<p>As far as technology is concerned, I am passionate about privacy, security, decentralizing the Internet, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOSS</a>. I don't go full-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stallman</a> on people, but I do enjoy helping people see the long-term consequences of much of the proprietary technology we use. I also do a fair amount of experimentation with open technologies so I can suggest (or provide) better alternatives.</p>
<p>Outside of technology, I am passionate about backpacking, mental health, respecting and listening to people with different world views, and worshipping God.</p>
