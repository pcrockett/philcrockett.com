        <p>The following is a list of things I think are awesome and worth sharing:</p>
<h2>Software and Services</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a>: What this site is built with. It is a static site generator, and in my opinion, it's infinitely easier to figure out than <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a>. I rewrote my old Hugo site from scratch in an afternoon (code can be found <a href="https://github.com/pcrockett/philcrockett.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Github</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://chat.crockett.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crockett Chat</a>: A private <a href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matrix</a> homeserver that I am <a href="https://github.com/pcrockett/crockett-vps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently working on</a>. If you're a Crockett family member, let me know and I'll send you an invitation.</li>
<li><a href="https://standardnotes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard Notes</a>: A great note taking app that syncs notes between devices. End-to-end encrypted, runs on all major OSes, 100% open source (both server and client code), self-hostable. The team behind it focuses on simplicity, core functionality, and longevity, rather than adding all kinds of bells and whistles. I have been dumping my brain into this app for over a year now and love it.</li>
<li><a href="https://podman.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Podman</a>: An alternative to <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a> I am currently playing with. It's almost 100% compatible with Docker, however it requires no daemon running as root. I also find it much easier to use and more reliable than <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LXC</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://keyoxide.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyoxide.org</a>: An interesting decentralized alternative to <a href="https://keybase.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keybase</a>. I haven't set up any proofs (not sure if I will), but you can see my Keyoxide profile <a href="https://keyoxide.org/contact@philcrockett.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It's kind of a toy at the moment - I have encountered no practical need for it yet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AllSides</a>: News aggregation website that seeks to organize articles based on their bias: left, right, or center. &quot;We expose people to information and ideas from all sides of the political spectrum so they can better understand the world - and each other.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://lobste.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lobste.rs</a>: Technology link aggregation site similar to Hacker News, but instead of focusing on entrepreneurship, the focus tends more toward free and open source software.</li>
<li><a href="https://thebibleproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Bible Project</a>: Produces really well-made videos and other content that helps normal people see the Bible from a big-picture perspective. Especially great for those who easily get distracted by religious minutiae, and brings Jesus Christ back in focus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qubes OS</a>: Security-focused operating system I do <strong>NOT</strong> recommend for most people. However it has a valid use case for a lot of people in riskier circumstances, and the idea behind it is brilliant. Unfortunately it runs too slowly on my aging personal laptop, and since I'm not a professional security researcher or controversial journalist, I don't really need it.</li>
<li><a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manjaro</a>: The operating system I <em>do</em> recommend to other people. I started out with <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu</a> because it's easy, popular, and well-supported. After a few years I decided to try something completely different, so landed on Manjaro. It's an Arch-based operating system that's way less intimidating than Arch itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://endeavouros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EndeavourOS</a>: The operating system I run as of this writing. It's a lightweight OS that strives to stay as close to plain vanilla Arch as possible, with only minimal additions to make it more approachable. This is basically halfway between Manjaro and Arch in terms of technical skill required. Great for diving deeper into Linux.</li>
<li><a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pop!_OS</a>: A developer-centric Linux distro, based on Ubuntu. I have not used it much, but from the little I've seen, it seems to &quot;just work,&quot; get out of the way, and let you get your job done. The UI is really slick too, especially because of the tiling window manager that comes with it. This will probably be my next laptop OS.</li>
<li><a href="https://e.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/e/OS</a>: A project based on <a href="https://lineageos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LineageOS</a> that seeks to bring privacy-friendly un-Googled Android to the masses. Also provides privacy-friendly services (email, cloud storage, etc) if you're interested in that sort of thing.</li>
</ul>
