        <p>The following is a list of things I think are awesome and worth sharing:</p>
<h2>Software and Services</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Eleventy</a>: What this site is built with. It is a static site generator, and in my opinion, it's infinitely easier to figure out than <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Jekyll</a>. I rewrote my old Hugo site from scratch in an afternoon (code can be found <a href="https://github.com/pcrockett/philcrockett.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">on Github</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://chat.crockett.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Crockett Chat</a>: A private <a href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Matrix</a> homeserver that I am <a href="https://github.com/pcrockett/crockett-vps" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">currently working on</a>. If you're a Crockett family member, let me know and I'll send you an invitation.</li>
<li><a href="https://standardnotes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Standard Notes</a>: A great note taking app that syncs notes between devices. End-to-end encrypted, runs on all major OSes, 100% open source (both server and client code), self-hostable. The team behind it focuses on simplicity, core functionality, and longevity, rather than adding all kinds of bells and whistles. I have been dumping my brain into this app for over a year now and love it.</li>
<li><a href="https://podman.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Podman</a>: An alternative to <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Docker</a> I am currently playing with. It's almost 100% compatible with Docker, however it requires no daemon running as root. I also find it much easier to use and more reliable than <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">LXC</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">AllSides</a>: News aggregation website that seeks to organize articles based on their bias: left, right, or center. &quot;We expose people to information and ideas from all sides of the political spectrum so they can better understand the world - and each other.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://lobste.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Lobste.rs</a>: Technology link aggregation site similar to Hacker News, but instead of focusing on entrepreneurship, the focus tends more toward free and open source software.</li>
<li><a href="https://thebibleproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">The Bible Project</a>: Produces really well-made videos and other content that helps normal people see the Bible from a big-picture perspective. Especially great for those who easily get distracted by religious minutiae, and brings Jesus Christ back in focus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Qubes OS</a>: Security-focused operating system I do <strong>NOT</strong> recommend for most people. However I personally enjoy it a lot, as computer security has developed into somewhat of a hobby for me. Qubes has a lot of awesome features that make it easy to go off the deep end with computer security.</li>
<li><a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Manjaro</a>: The operating system I <em>do</em> recommend to other people (along with <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">Ubuntu</a>). I started out with Ubuntu because it's arguably the most noob-friendly Linux out there. After a few years I decided to try something completely different, so landed on Manjaro. It's an Arch-based operating system that's way less intimidating than Arch.</li>
<li><a href="https://endeavouros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">EndeavourOS</a>: The operating system I run as of this writing. It's a lightweight OS that strives to stay as close to plain vanilla Arch as possible, with only minimal additions to make it more approachable. This is basically halfway between Manjaro and Arch in terms of technical skill required. Great for diving deeper into Linux.</li>
<li><a href="https://e.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">/e/OS</a>: A project based on <a href="https://lineageos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener me">LineageOS</a> that seeks to bring privacy-friendly un-Googled Android to the masses. Also provides privacy-friendly services (email, cloud storage, etc) if you're interested in that sort of thing.</li>
</ul>
