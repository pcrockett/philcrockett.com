    <section>
        <p>The following is a list of things I think are awesome and worth sharing:</p>
<h2 id="software-and-services" tabindex="-1">Software and Services</h2>
<h3 id="eleventy" tabindex="-1">Eleventy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.11ty.dev/</a></p>
<p>A simple static site generator which I personally find to be more intuitive than
<a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a>. The source for this
website can be found <a href="https://github.com/pcrockett/philcrockett.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tailscale" tabindex="-1">Tailscale</h3>
<p><a href="https://tailscale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tailscale.com/</a></p>
<p>“A secure network that just works.” A mesh VPN that gives your devices the ability to automatically find
each other and establish direct encrypted connections when possible. Relies on the
<a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WireGuard protocol</a>. I use it extensively, including some of the less
documented features like <a href="https://github.com/pcrockett/tailscale-container" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exit nodes</a> and
<a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subnet routers</a>. It's a networking Swiss army knife.</p>
<h3 id="standard-notes" tabindex="-1">Standard Notes</h3>
<p><a href="https://standardnotes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://standardnotes.org/</a></p>
<p>A great note-taking app that syncs notes between devices. End-to-end encrypted, runs on all major OSes, 100% open
source (both server and client code), self-hostable, and the team behind it has a really admirable business model.
Downside: It's developed in JavaScript, and when you have thousands of notes, it really bogs down (especially on
Android). Currently looking for a replacement.</p>
<h2 id="software-development" tabindex="-1">Software Development</h2>
<h3 id="kotlin" tabindex="-1">Kotlin</h3>
<p><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://kotlinlang.org/</a></p>
<p>Known mostly for Android development and often treated as a “better Java,” it is so much more. For me, it
has been a great introduction to functional programming, and I <em>love</em> it. Though I have a theory that I'm still
testing: I think it may only be practical to write significant amounts of Kotlin in an
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IntelliJ</a>-based IDE. It would be extremely difficult to write more
than a few lines of Kotlin in a text editor like Vim or GEdit.</p>
<h3 id="my-bash-script-template" tabindex="-1">My Bash Script Template</h3>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/pcrockett/8e04641f8473081c3a93de744873f787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gist.github.com/pcrockett/8e04641f8473081c3a93de744873f787</a></p>
<p>Bash is a terrible language. But it's not so bad if you're using <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShellCheck</a>
and you have a nice template to start from. I copy / paste / modify this script any time I want to automate something
new in Linux. I also use it for things like syntax reminders, and I update it periodically when I discover something
new and useful.</p>
<h2 id="operating-systems" tabindex="-1">Operating Systems</h2>
<h3 id="desktop-linux-distros" tabindex="-1">Desktop Linux Distros</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/#introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedora Silverblue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pop!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archlinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These three operating systems are my current favorites, and I can never decide which one I want to keep installed on my
laptop. Silverblue is an immutable OS (the future!), Pop is a joy to use when I actually want to get stuff done (amazing
keyboard-driven UI), and Arch is great for tinkering.</p>
<h3 id="grapheneos" tabindex="-1">GrapheneOS</h3>
<p><a href="https://grapheneos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://grapheneos.org/</a></p>
<p>A privacy and security-oriented fork of Android. For a while I used <a href="https://e.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/e/OS</a>,
however I discovered that /e/ is over-extended. They try to support too many phone models and too much software, with
not enough resources. This leads to low-quality outdated software, which is frustrating and insecure. Graphene is the
opposite; They only support recent Pixel models, meaning they have the resources to keep up, and they produce an
extremely polished, high-quality OS.</p>
<h2 id="devices" tabindex="-1">Devices</h2>
<h3 id="raspberry-pi" tabindex="-1">Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.raspberrypi.org/</a></p>
<p>A great little computer that's affordable and surprisingly powerful. Great for tinkering and learning, as well as
running a tiny efficient home server or simple desktop PC. I have a couple Pis in a couple different locations running
<a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arch ARM</a> and
<a href="#tailscale">Tailscale</a>. They are subnet routers and exit nodes, giving me access to a lot of things no matter where I
am in the world.</p>
<h2 id="security" tabindex="-1">Security</h2>
<h3 id="security-planner" tabindex="-1">Security Planner</h3>
<p><a href="https://securityplanner.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://securityplanner.org/</a></p>
<p>Answer a few questions, and get a simple plan for improving your privacy and security, with links to useful resources
for further education. Very user-friendly, great for people ranging from aging parents to journalists.</p>
<h3 id="qubes-os" tabindex="-1">Qubes OS</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.qubes-os.org/</a></p>
<p>A high-security operating system that uses virtual machines to compartmentalize various areas of life. Often used by
security researchers or other people in high-risk situations. I used it for a few months and was really impressed,
though it ended up being too sluggish on my aging laptop.</p>
<h2 id="information" tabindex="-1">Information</h2>
<h3 id="allsides" tabindex="-1">AllSides</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news</a></p>
<p>News aggregation website that seeks to organize articles based on their bias: left, right, or center. “We expose
people to information and ideas from all sides of the political spectrum so they can better understand the world — and
each other.”</p>
<h3 id="lobsters" tabindex="-1">Lobsters</h3>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://lobste.rs/</a></p>
<p>Technology link aggregation site similar to Hacker News, but instead of focusing on entrepreneurship, the focus tends
more toward free and open source software.</p>
<h2 id="fun" tabindex="-1">Fun</h2>
<h3 id="screeps" tabindex="-1">Screeps</h3>
<p><a href="https://screeps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://screeps.com/</a></p>
<p>MMO sandbox game for programmers. Like a real-time strategy game, but it's constantly running even when you're not
logged in, and all your units are controlled by code that you write. It's also a good opportunity to improve your
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a> skills.</p>
