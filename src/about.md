I am an American living in Germany with my wife and dog. We spend our free time hanging out with people, going outside, playing games, and traveling. I work remotely for an American company building software, while my wife teaches English.

As far as technology is concerned, I am passionate about privacy, security, decentralizing the Internet, and {% newTabLink "FOSS" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" %}. I don't go full-{% newTabLink "Stallman" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" %} on people, but I do enjoy helping people see the long-term consequences of much of the proprietary technology we use. I also do a fair amount of experimentation with open technologies so I can suggest (or provide) better alternatives.

Outside of technology, I am passionate about backpacking, mental health, respecting and listening to people with different world views, and worshipping God.
