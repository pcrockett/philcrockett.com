title: About
---

I am an American living in Germany with my wife, son, and dog. I work for a company in Berlin as a senior software
engineer, and my wife teaches English.

Technology-wise, I am passionate about privacy, security, {% newTabLink "FOSS" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" %},
and sustainability. I think a lot about the long-term consequences of the technology we use, and I spend a lot of time
tinkering with open technologies. I'm a Linux enthusiast.

As I get older, I find myself spending more time outside â€” backpacking, rock climbing, camping, etc. I'm also a fan of
coffee, strategy games, history, and theology.
