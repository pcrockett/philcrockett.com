Here's a throwback to the 90s: A page full of links! The following is a list of things I think are awesome and worth sharing:

* [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/): Technology link aggregation site similar to Hacker News, but instead of focusing on entrepreneurship, the focus tends more toward free and open source software.
* [AllSides](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news): News aggregation website that seeks to organize articles based on their bias: left, right, or center. "We expose people to information and ideas from all sides of the political spectrum so they can better understand the world - and each other."
* [The Bible Project](https://thebibleproject.com/): Produces really well-made videos and other content that helps normal people see how the whole Bible points to Jesus. It helps Christians who tend to forget the big picture and get stuck in minute details. It also does a good job of pushing against the misconception that the Bible is a religious rulebook.
* [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/): Security-focused operating system I do **NOT** recommend for most people. However I personally enjoy it a lot, as computer security has developed into somewhat of a hobby for me. Qubes has a lot of awesome features that make it easy to go off the deep end with computer security.
* [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/): The operating system I _do_ recommend to other people (along with [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop)). I started out with Ubuntu because it's arguably the most noob-friendly Linux out there. After a few years I decided to try something completely different, so landed on Manjaro. It's an Arch-based operating system that's way less intimidating than Arch.
* [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat/): Chat app that uses your existing email provider to send and receive messages, and competes with the likes of WhatsApp in terms of features and user-friendliness. It has lots of potential, but I wish it worked better with people who are using traditional email applications. We'll see where it goes.
