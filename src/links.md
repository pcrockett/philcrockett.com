The following is a list of things I think are awesome and worth sharing:

## Software and Services

* {% newTabLink "Eleventy" "https://www.11ty.dev" %}: A simple static site generator which I personally find to be more intuitive than {% newTabLink "Hugo" "https://gohugo.io/" %} or {% newTabLink "Jekyll" "https://jekyllrb.com/" %}. The source for this website can be found {% newTabLink "on GitHub" "https://github.com/pcrockett/philcrockett.com" %}.
* {% newTabLink "Standard Notes" "https://standardnotes.org/" %}: A great note-taking app that syncs notes between devices. End-to-end encrypted, runs on all major OSes, 100% open source (both server and client code), self-hostable, and the team behind it has a really admirable business model.
* {% newTabLink "My Bash script template" "https://gist.github.com/pcrockett/8e04641f8473081c3a93de744873f787" %}: Bash is a terrible language. But it's not so bad if you're using {% newTabLink "ShellCheck" "https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck" %} and you have a nice template to start from. I copy / paste / modify this script any time I want to automate something new in Linux. I also use it for things like syntax reminders, and I update it periodically when I discover something new and useful.

## Operating Systems

* {% newTabLink "Fedora Silverblue" "https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/#introduction" %}: The Linux distribution currently running on my laptop. It's an "immutable" variant of {% newTabLink "Fedora Workstation" "https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/" %}, relying on {% newTabLink "OSTree" "https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/introduction/" %} instead of a traditional package manager. It is minimalistic and yet very polished, and thanks to its immutable design, I don't have to worry about irreversibly cluttering up my system over time.
* {% newTabLink "/e/OS" "https://e.foundation/" %}: A project based on {% newTabLink "LineageOS" "https://lineageos.org/" %} that seeks to bring privacy-friendly un-Googled Android to the masses. Also provides privacy-friendly services (email, cloud storage, etc) if you're interested in that sort of thing. Still very beta, but usable.

## Devices

* {% newTabLink "Fairphone" "https://www.fairphone.com/" %}: A modular Android phone that aims to be easy to repair, sustainable, and fair trade. You can also {% newTabLink "get it preinstalled with /e/OS" "https://esolutions.shop/shop/e-os-fairphone-3-plus/" %}. Sadly, it only ships to Europe.
* {% newTabLink "Raspberry Pi" "https://www.raspberrypi.org/" %}: A great little computer that's affordable and surprisingly powerful. Great for tinkering and learning, as well as running a tiny efficient home server or simple desktop PC.

## Security

* {% newTabLink "Security Planner" "https://securityplanner.org/" %}: Answer a few questions, and get a simple plan for improving your privacy and security, with links to useful resources for further education. Very user-friendly, great for people ranging from aging parents to journalists.
* {% newTabLink "Qubes OS" "https://www.qubes-os.org/" %}: A high-security operating system that uses virtual machines to compartmentalize various areas of life. Often used by security researchers or other people in high-risk situations. I used it for a few months and was really impressed, though it ended up being too sluggish on my aging laptop.

## Information

* {% newTabLink "AllSides" "https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news" %}: News aggregation website that seeks to organize articles based on their bias: left, right, or center. "We expose people to information and ideas from all sides of the political spectrum so they can better understand the world â€” and each other."
* {% newTabLink "Lobste.rs" "https://lobste.rs/" %}: Technology link aggregation site similar to Hacker News, but instead of focusing on entrepreneurship, the focus tends more toward free and open source software.

## Fun

* {% newTabLink "Screeps" "https://screeps.com/" %}: MMO sandbox game for programmers. Like a real-time strategy game, but it's constantly running even when you're not logged in, and all your units are controlled by code that you write. It's also a good opportunity to improve your {% newTabLink "TypeScript" "https://www.typescriptlang.org/" %} skills.
