This is the beginning of my collection of notes.

No, this is not a blog. I've tried maintaining a blog before, and always had trouble keeping up with it or finding
things to write. Instead, I hope to keep this all very small and informal. It's just a place to quickly dump my
thoughts.

_Maybe_ I'll use this to [<strike>blog</strike> write about what I've struggled with](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/24/blog-about-what-you-ve-struggled-with/).
Or maybe I'll turn it into a sort of [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).
