So this year (2025) was my first year to visit [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/). It was
also my first time in Belgium. I started writing down these tips as I learned them.
_If you are more experienced and you want to correct anything here, please do
[let me know](/contact/)._

## Preparing for FOSDEM

1. If you're an Android person, install
   [FOSDEM Companion](https://f-droid.org/packages/be.digitalia.fosdem/)[^1] and start
   bookmarking tracks you're interested in. That will come in handy on FOSDEM day, trust
   me. 
1. If you can, pack your own lunch and bring it with you to the conference. The food
   trucks are great, but expect to pay 10 EUR or more for lunch, and the lines get
   _really_ long around lunchtime.

[^1]: FOSDEM recommends this app, and others, on their [mobile schedule apps page](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/mobile/).

## Getting to the conference

1. FOSDEM has a page with instructions to get to the conference, and it's good
   information. For the 2025 conference it was [here](https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/transportation/).
1. If you're coming from the airport, there's an airport train line that will take you
   to the city center. You can buy tickets at the [STIB-MIVB website](https://www.stib-mivb.be/home).
   Look for "Airport2City 1 Journey." As of this writing, I think it's the cheapest way
   to get to the city center for 7.90 EUR if you buy online. Don't use the ticket kiosks
   at the airport.[^2]
1. The busses to the university are packed with FOSDEM attendees. Please be courteous to
   the Brussels locals, who are not accustomed to having their morning commute packed
   so tightly with foreigners who are unfamiliar with the language and transit system.
1. The easiest way to pay the bus fare is to swipe a bank card on the contactless
   payment doodad thingy. You don't even need to talk to the bus driver or push any
   buttons. Just swipe your card.[^3]

[^2]: I used the ticket kiosks at the airport and ended up paying about 3 EUR more.
[^3]: Concerningly, I don't actually know how much I paid because it didn't show me
      a price...

## At the conference

1. If you see a ridiculously long line when you arrive first thing in the morning, it's
   **not** for registration.[^4] Instead, it's probably a line for buying t-shirts and
   hoodies. They are apparently very high-demand, especially in the morning because they
   will run out of certain sizes later. So I _do_ recommend standing in that line... if
   buying some swag is important to you.
1. The lines for coffee in the morning are long. If you can bring your own, do it. _Or
   alternatively use the long lines as an opportunity to get into conversations with
   other fellow nerds._
1. Show up at rooms early. Depending on the room, you may need to be there 30 minutes
   early. They often reach full capacity long before the talk starts.
1. If you're interested in a talk that's being given by a relatively famous person,
   you may need to get into the room for the _preceeding talk_, before the one you're
   actually interested in.[^5]

[^4]: FOSDEM doesn't require you to register, check in, or anything like that.
[^5]: For example, during FOSDEM 2025 most of the people in the Security room just
      stayed in their seats after one particular talk, which means only a handful of
      people in the hallway got in to hear [Daniel Steinberg](https://daniel.haxx.se/)
      speak.

## Other tips

I'm not the first person to produce content like this on the Internet. A quick search,
for example, yielded [this very good first-timer FOSDEM guide](https://pothix.com/fosdem-guide/)
which has more useful information. I'm sure there are plenty of others.
