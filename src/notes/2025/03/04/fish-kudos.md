Just look at [this monumental feat][fish-release].

I gotta say, the dev team behind fish really seems to know how to dev. They:

* pulled off a rewrite
* care enough about their users to...
  * keep track of breaking changes and communicate them in great detail
  * understand when to break things vs deprecate them
* value POSIX compatibility while at the same time not allowing POSIX to ruin their
  project

etc.

Of course weâ€™ll see for sure how well it turns out after a few point releases, but so
far at least, it seems like they deserve a standing ovation. I wonder how old they are,
because it looks to me like they have a lot of hard-won experience and discernment.[^1]

    started wanting to "own my words," so I decided to duplicate the post here.
