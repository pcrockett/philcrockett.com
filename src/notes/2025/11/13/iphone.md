**tl;dr:** If you're going for lowest total cost of ownership, iPhone will serve you
better than Android or its derivative operating systems. You'll have to sacrifice
your software freedom, but then again... maybe we never had much freedom in any mobile
ecosystem in the first place.

As a freedom-loving FOSS nerd, my mobile device of choice has traditionally been
Android-based. In particular, I have been very happy using a Pixel 5a with [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/).

And then the phone died. And I'm frustrated that the total cost of ownership (TCO) for
that old phone (it was already old when I bought it) was 11 Euros per month.[^1]

[^1]: I like to think of mobile device ownership cost in per-month terms. It makes it
  feel like a subscription. However since basically everyone _needs_ a mobile device
  in order to function in modern society, it's more like a tax than a subscription. And
  most of those taxes go directly to either Google or Apple.

If you are fine with upgrading your mobile device every 2 years, then Android is
compelling. You're going to be dropping a lot of cash on phones this way, so you might
as well buy the cheaper devices.

However if your goal is to avoid using your mobile device as much as possible, and you
want to spend as little money as possible on this horrible[^1] ecosystem.... Android
makes zero sense. While iPhones may be more expensive up front, they offer better
hardware and longer software support. Apple devices are useable _in practice_ for twice
as long as their equivalent Android devices, yet do _not_ cost twice as much.[^2]

[^2]: Of course if you go the iPhone route, you're giving away a lot of software
  freedom and replacing it with a walled garden. Though honestly folks, if you want
  _reasonably-priced_ software freedom, Android (including its derivatives) isn't
  the place to go. The mobile ecosystem is broken, and will stay broken until our
  governments figure out a way to uproot this insane Google / Apple duopoly. Choose a
  device that gives you a reasonable degree of privacy, use it when you're forced to,
  and get back to a Linux device for everything else.

So today I bought a refurbished iPhone 13 mini with a new battery. Along with a case
and screen protector, it cost around 300 Euros. This is a 4-year-old phone. If I can get
it to last another 4 years (until 2029) (with perhaps one battery replacement), I can
expect TCO to be around 7 Euros per month. My stretch goal will be to get it to last 6
years, bringing TCO down to less than 5 Euros per month.
