[I bought an iPhone two months ago.](/notes/2025/11/13/iphone/) So far, it seems like a
good decision.

* My phone screen time has gone down to an average of less than 1 hour per day.[^1]
* I'm surprised at how far I can get without any App Store downloads.[^2]
* I have yet to activate iCloud.[^3] It (pleasantly) surprises me that Apple allows this
  to be optional.
* Automation via the Shortcuts app is pretty great.[^4]

I thought it would be more of a struggle to resist the pull of Apple's ecosystem, but
so far I haven't had any problems keeping Apple at arm's length despite owning one of
their devices.

[^1]: Of course my laptop screen time has gone _up_ significantly, but that was the
  intended effect. One of my goals was to get out of the mobile ecosystem as much as
  possible and spend more time on devices I control.
[^2]: You can setup Fastmail with minimal effort using iOS-native mail, calendar, and
  reminders apps. iOS's support for open standards like iCAL is surprisingly great
  out-of-the-box. I _have_ downloaded a few apps, but so far haven't needed to buy any.
[^3]: Backing things up encourages me to feel like my device is "safe" and can be
  relied upon, which increases dependence. The whole goal of this experiment is to avoid
  dependence on the mobile ecosystem as much as possible, so I avoid backup solutions
  like iCloud intentionally. So far the only backup I have needed is for photos and
  videos, that that is handled by [Ente](https://ente.io/).
[^4]: Example: My phone automatically turns airplane mode on and off when I join or
  leave a Wi-Fi network. My battery likes this; staying connected to cell towers sucks
  a huge amount of battery life compared to Wi-Fi. Since Wi-Fi calling works _reliably_
  on iOS, I now have a nearly seamless way to remain connected, while increasing battery
  longevity.
